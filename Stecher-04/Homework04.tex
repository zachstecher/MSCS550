\section*{Problem 1) Modify the code provided to generate 1000 data points and, using 10-fold CV, report the best values of k-neighbors that yield the best CV $E_{out}$. Report the best $E_{out}$.}

The only modification I needed to make to the provided code was to change the value of genDataSet(100) to genDataSet(1000). I also removed the lines that plotted the data as they became unnecessary. I modified the k-neighbors code we worked on in class to report the score and the three best k-neighbors values and ran the program multiple times. On the final run, my $E_{out}$ score ended up being a 0.137986913985, with k-neighbors values of 216, 208 and 214. These values fluctuated slightly with each run because of the random data generator used.

\section*{Problem 2) Modify the code to repeat the experiment 100 times, saving the best thee k-neighbors values in every single trial, and plot a histogram of all the values of k that were saved.}

For this problem, I wrapped the code used in problem 1 inside a for loop to run 100 times, only generating the data once at the start. I also added in an array named bestklist to save each k-neighbors value that the regressor determined to be the best for each iteration. I tried this two ways, once with the data generator outside the for-loop so that it would use the same exact data every time, and once with the data generator inside the for-loop so that each of the 100 experiments would have it's own generated data. When I kept the generator outside the for-loop, it resulted in achieving the same three k-neighbor values 100 times each. By moving the generator into the for-loop, I ended up with a slightly more even spread, however the majority of the results still hovered around the 250-350 range:
